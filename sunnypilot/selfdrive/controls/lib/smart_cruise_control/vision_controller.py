# GS450h PLN-1_1 (2026-08-08): this used to be a flat 2.0, which is far more conservative than
# how this car is actually driven here. Measured over 23 seg of hill road (route 1d, SCC-V
# replayed with archive/probes/_scc_replay.py --scan --assume-on): 59 interventions asking for a
# median of 9 km/h BELOW the speed the driver actually took the same corner at. That constant
# nagging is why SCC-V was switched off around 07-05 and stayed off for six weeks.
# Relaxing it to a flat 3.0 removes the nagging (median gap +1.5 km/h) but also gives up the
# corners that matter (5th pct gap -21.7 -> -14.2). Making it depend on how sharp the turn ahead
# actually looks keeps both: measured median gap -2.4 km/h, 5th pct -22.2 km/h.
# The top end is 2.6 rather than the comfort-book 2.0 on purpose. The corners that land there are
# 6-8 s chains of bends on prefectural routes 60/64 through the hills, taken at a near-constant
# 43-49 km/h. Asking for 20 km/h is defensible on comfort grounds alone, but on a mountain road the
# driver has already braced for the lateral load - it is expected, not a surprise - so applying a

# that Japanese right-angle junctions produce, so the car coasted into the turn and the driver had
# to brake (route 1d seg24, Iiyama-Kannon junction: entering fired 4.4 s early, actual decel -0.1).
# Verified offline with archive/probes/_scc_replay.py on that rlog: with SCC-V enabled the stock
# setup reaches 33.9 km/h at the apex where the human took 30.9. This table on its own (against a
# flat 2.0 limit) reaches 29.4; together with the curvature-dependent limit above it lands at 36.3,
# i.e. slacker than stock right here. That is a deliberate trade the driver signed off on: 4 s out
# this junction predicts only 1.58 m/s2, indistinguishable from a gentle bend, so buying it back
# would cost the "stop nagging me everywhere else" the same knob is there to deliver.
